zlib is a general-purpose lossless data compression C library. The data format
used by the library is described by RFCs 1950, 1951, and 1952 (zlib, deflate,
and gzip formats, respectively). For more information see:

https://www.zlib.net/

This package contains the original libz library source code overlaid with the
build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager (bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself to
zlib@gzip.org or to Gilles Vollant at info@winimage.com (Windows DLL-related
questions). Send build system and packaging-related feedback to the
packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for posting
guidelines, etc).

The packaging of zlib for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/zlib/
